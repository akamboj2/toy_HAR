# Note to reviewers:

This file contains all the experiments outlined for the SF-CMT submission. 

We acknolwedge that although the motivation and methods may be sound, the experiments described in the paper are a little light. We are actively working on running larger more robust experiments, and on different datasets. If given the opportunity, we would be happy to add an extra table or more data points on the existing tables in support of our method before the final submission.

Furthermore, this code will be signficantly polished with explicit instructions to reproduce the experiments and will published to github by the ICML conference to insure reproducability of this work.

Most of the relevant work can be found in IMU_RGB/train.py.
